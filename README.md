  CODE4MEC is a cooperative defense framework for MEC. It aims to adapt to defense workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning container-carrie defense resources from a cluster of MEC nodes in an automatic way.
  
  CODE4MEC framework contains two kinds of components, i.e., the controller and MEC nodes. 
  For the controller, the CDO project is included, which works as a module in the floodlight.
  As for the MEC nodes, two projects are included, i.e., the UFD and CXXPure(refered to as CFE in our paper) project.
  
  For the detailed illustration of CODE4MEC framework, please refer to our paper.
